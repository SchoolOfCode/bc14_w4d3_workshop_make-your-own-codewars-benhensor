/* 

You are given an array of integers.

Write a function that takes this array and returns a new array in which each integer is doubled.

But! If any of the doubled values are greater than or equal to 10, they must be split into two separate elements in the output array.

For example, if the input array is [3, 4, 5], the output array should be [6, 8, 1, 0] because 6 and 8 are less than 10,
but 10 (5 doubled) is greater than or equal to 10 and therefore split into two separate elements.

Remember to complete the array to test your solutions!

const array = [];

export function doubleTrouble(array) {
// Your code here

console.log(doubleTrouble(array));
